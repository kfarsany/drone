Image Processing Drone

Done in cooperation with Zachary Agness, Leo Leal, and June Chen
Advised by Mahdi Maaref and John Agness.
UCI capstone senior design project (September 2019 - March 2020)

The U.S. Navy outlined a project entailing a drone that could do any type of image proceessing during flight.
This repository contains two important aspects of the drone's software: GUI and Arduino communications from drone to computer.
Some items are experimental, such as voice commands and advanced mapping functions.
The physical drone/hardware resides with Zachary Agness.  This software only works with that drone, as both hardware and software were done from scratch.
